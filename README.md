# Parking Lot Pathfinder

This program simulates an **optimal parking slot finder** using classic **pathfinding algorithms** — **A***, **Dijkstra**, and **BFS** — to determine the most efficient route inside a **multi-floor parking building**.

Each parking floor is represented as a **`.csv` map file** stored inside the `maps/` folder.

Each `.csv` file represents **one parking floor**, and all files are placed inside the `maps/` directory.

Current project state:

* 10 floors provided (`floor0.csv` … `floor9.csv`), each sized 20×20.
* Stairs/Elevator (`S`) are aligned across floors for vertical navigation.
* Car start (`C`) and Lobby (`O`) are on `floor0.csv`.

## Map Format (CSV)
## Map Format (CSV)

* The map size is **flexible** (recommended: 20×20 for testing).
* Use commas (`,`) to separate each cell.
* Each cell contains **one character** from the symbol table below:

| Symbol | Meaning                                                 |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#`    | Wall / obstacle (cannot be passed)                      |
| `.`    | Normal road (bidirectional path)                        |
| `>`    | One-way road to the **right**                           |
| `<`    | One-way road to the **left**                            |
| `^`    | One-way road **upward**                                 |
| `v`    | One-way road **downward**                               |
| `S`    | Stair / elevator (connects the same cell across floors) |
| `C`    | Car (**starting point**)                                |
| `P`    | Regular parking slot (**default goal**)                 |
| `L`    | **Ladies parking slot**                                 |
| `D`    | **Disability parking slot**                             |
| `O`    | **Lobby** (destination after parking)                   |

## How It Works
## How It Works

1. The program loads all `.csv` files in the `maps/` folder (each file = one floor).
2. You choose which algorithm(s) to run:

   * `A*`
   * `Dijkstra`
   * `BFS`
   * `Run all` → runs all three and compares their times.
3. Then choose which **parking type** to look for:

   * Normal (`P`)
   * Ladies (`L`)
   * Disability (`D`)
4. You’ll also be asked to input a **desired floor** —
   the program will **prioritize slots closer to that floor** (e.g., if you prefer floor 5, it’ll prefer nearby floors).
5. Optionally, you can choose whether to **display the full path**.
6. The program finds the **best parking slot** based on:

   * Shortest path from the **car (`C`)** to the slot.
   * Shortest path from the **lobby (`O`)** to the same slot.
   * Floor difference from the **desired floor**.
7. The **total combined cost** is calculated as:

   ```
   cost = distance(Car→Slot) + distance(Lobby→Slot) + (|floor - desired_floor| * 5)
   ```

   *(The floor difference is multiplied by 5 as a penalty weight — closer floors are preferred.)*
8. The slot with the **lowest combined cost** is chosen as the **optimal parking spot**.
9. Each algorithm prints its **execution time in seconds**.

Then follow the prompts:

```
[1] A*
[2] Dijkstra
[3] BFS
[4] Run all
Choose algorithm: 4

Parking Type:
[1] Normal
[2] Ladies
[3] Disability
Choose type: 1

Enter desired floor number (0 = ground):
Desired floor: 5

Show paths? (y/n): n
```

## Example Output
## Example Output

```
=== Running A_STAR ===
Best slot: Floor 4, Pos (2, 8)
Total combined cost (Car + Lobby + Floor offset): 52
Execution Time: 0.0312 seconds

=== Running DIJKSTRA ===
Best slot: Floor 4, Pos (2, 8)
Total combined cost (Car + Lobby + Floor offset): 52
Execution Time: 0.0345 seconds

=== Running BFS ===
Best slot: Floor 4, Pos (2, 8)
Total combined cost (Car + Lobby + Floor offset): 52
Execution Time: 0.0301 seconds
```

If you chose `Show paths? = y`, the program also prints detailed coordinates for both routes:

```
Path from Car → Slot:
  Floor 0 → (1, 0)
  Floor 0 → (1, 1)
  ...

Path from Lobby → Slot:
  Floor 0 → (3, 0)
  Floor 0 → (3, 1)
  ...
```

## 🧠 Notes

* Each map **must contain at least**:

  * One car (`C`)
  * One lobby (`O`)
  * At least one parking slot (`P`, `L`, or `D`)
* Stairs/elevators (`S`) **must be aligned** across floors for vertical travel to work.
* Be careful with **one-way roads** (`> < ^ v`) — they can block paths if placed wrong.
* The program automatically detects and warns about missing key symbols (`missing C, P, or O`).
* Use **larger maps** (e.g., 30×30 or more) to better compare algorithm efficiency.
* The **floor preference** penalty (×5) can be adjusted in code to change how much floor proximity matters.
